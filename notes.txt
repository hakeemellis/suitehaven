Purpose of useState:

useState is used to manage state within a React functional component. 
It allows you to create and update state variables, which trigger re-renders of the component when their values change.

Purpose of useEffect:

useEffect is used to perform side effects in functional components, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or DOM manipulation. 
It runs after every render of the component, including the initial render and subsequent updates.

All in all;
Essentially, useState is like a function (with the ability to set the state of variables) and 
useEffect is what enables the state changes alongside other things
